Create a new solution called FootballTeamManager.

Create 2 domain models:
- Player model containing the following properties:
	- PlayerId
	- FirstName
	- LastName
	- Position (enum with options Forward, Midfielder, Back, Goalkeeper)
	- Salary
- Team model containing the following properties:
	- TeamId
	- Name
	- Players (list of Player)
	- League (integer)

Create 2 controllers:
- PlayerController containing 2 methods:
	- GetPlayerById returning a Player object with the provided ID
	- AddPlayer that will be used to add a player using a submit form
- TeamController containing 1 method:
	- GetTeamById returning a Team object with the provided ID

Create 3 views:
- ShowPlayer view that is used by GetPlayerById method and uses HTML/tag helpers to show the player's properties
(directly initialize a player object in the action)
- AddPlayer that will be used by AddPlayer method that has a submit form for ALL properties (dropdown for position)
- ShowTeam used by GetTeamById that shows the properties and lists all players below (hint: you can use a for loop)
(directly initialize a team and a few players in the action)

In the layout file, replace the current menu items with 3 links for all of the actions in the 2 controllers.
