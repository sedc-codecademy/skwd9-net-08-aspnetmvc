# Homework - Class 10

Use the SEDC.PizzaApp.Refactored project from Class 10

We need to implement the Feedbacks feature using a real database.

1. make the appropriate changes in the DB Context
 
2. Add seeding for initial feedbacks

3. Implement the CRUD operations for Feedback from the previous homework using Entity Framework. Create the needed new repositories or update the exisiting ones.

## Bonus
Try to use Include and ThenInclude in the PizzaRepository to return the connected Orders.
