# Homework - Class 02
Work with the SEDC.PizzaApp

1. Create new Controller for managing Orders (name it accordingly)

2. Add Index action that returns a view with a simple html that says “List of orders”. 
It should be accessed through custom route http://localhost/Orders

3. Add Details action with optional parameter id. 
If id is null it should return empty action result, else it should return a view with simple html. It should be accessed through route http://localhost/[Controller Name]/Details/{id?}

4. Add an action that returns Json (create an example model), it should be accessed by http://localhost/[Controller Name]/JsonData.

5. Add an action that redirects to Action Index in Home Controller.

## Bonus
Create model for Order and static list consisting of several orders. Use it in the Details action (refer to the demo for hint)
