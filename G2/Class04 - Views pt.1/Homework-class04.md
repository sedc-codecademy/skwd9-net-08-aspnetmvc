# Homework - Class 04

Use the SEDC.PizzaApp project from Class 04

1. Add property IsOnPromotion to the Pizza Model and the PizzaViewModel if there isn't already a property called IsPromotion. Use an if expression in the Pizza Details View 
and add a h4 tag that will say whether the pizza is on promotion or not depending on the property IsOnPromotion.

2. Add a SeeUsers action in the Home controller. This action should return a view that shows all the full names of the users in the system. 

3. Add partial view for showing details of a pizza and use it in both the Pizza Index and Pizza Details view. Index view should list the pizzas and Details should show details for one.
